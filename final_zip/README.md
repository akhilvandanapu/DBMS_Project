CS- 562 Database Management Systems-2 Final Project
====================================================

In this we built a query processing engine, which will take input as MF-struct (the phi operator) and produce a python file , which we will then run to get the output of the MF/EMF query.

To run this code,

1)Make sure you are in that folder where we have all the files
2)run "python generator.py" 
[Which is the main file and which inturn calls the helper file to generate the whole code]
3)For input just give the name of the input text file for example you can give 
"basicsql_q1.txt" or "mf_q2.txt" or "mf_q3.txt" or "emf_q4.txt" or "emf_q5.txt"
or you can just do a enter and it will ask you inline input for each of those attributes.
4)Now already generated file would be there in the same folder.
5)To see the final output, you can just run "python generated.py"
